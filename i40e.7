.SH NAME
i40e \- This file describes the Linux* Base Driver for the Intel Ethernet
Controller XL710 Family of Controllers.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PD 0.4v
modprobe i40e [<option>=<VAL1>,<VAL2>,...]
.br
.PD 1v
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
This driver supports the \fB2.6.32\fR and newer kernels, and includes support
for any 64 bit Linux supported system, including Itanium(R)2, x86_64, PPC64,
ARM, etc.
.LP
This driver is only supported as a loadable module at this time.  Intel is not
supplying patches against the kernel source to allow for static linking of the
driver.  For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the
documentation supplied with your adapter.  All hardware requirements listed
apply to use with Linux.
.SH JUMBO FRAMES
The driver supports Jumbo Frames.  Jumbo Frames support is enabled by changing
the MTU to a value larger than the default of 1500.  Use the ifconfig command
to increase the MTU size.  For example, enter the following where ethX is the
interface name:
.IP
ifconfig ethX mtu 9000 up
.LP
The maximum MTU setting for Jumbo Frames is 9706.  This value coincides with
the maximum Jumbo Frames size of 9728.  This driver will attempt to use
multiple page sized buffers to receive each jumbo packet.  This should help to
avoid buffer starvation issues when allocating receive packets.
.SH SUPPORT
For additional information, including supported adapters, building, and
installation, see the README file included with the driver.

If an issue is identified with the released source code on a supported kernel
with a supported adapter, email the specific information related to the issue
to e1000-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.
