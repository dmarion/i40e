.TH i40e 1 "October 20, 2020"
.SH NAME
i40e \-This file describes the Linux* Base Driver
for the Intel Ethernet Controller XL710 Family of Controllers.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PD 0.4v
modprobe i40e [<option>=<VAL1>,<VAL2>,...]
.PD 1v
.SH DESCRIPTION
This driver is intended for \fB2.6.32\fR and newer kernels. A version of the driver may already be included by your distribution and/or the kernel.org kernel.

This driver includes support for any 64 bit Linux supported system, x86_64, PPC64, ARM, etc.
.LP
This driver is only supported as a loadable module at this time. Intel is not supplying patches against the kernel source to allow for static linking of the drivers.


For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your Intel adapter. All hardware requirements listed apply to
use with Linux.
.SH Jumbo Frames
.LP
Jumbo Frames support is enabled by changing the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) to a value larger than the default value of 1500.

Use the ip command to increase the MTU size. For example, enter the following where <ethX> is the interface number:

# ip link set mtu 9000 dev <ethX>
# ip link set up dev <ethX>

.LP
NOTE: The maximum MTU setting for jumbo frames is 9702. This corresponds to the maximum jumbo frame size of 9728 bytes.

NOTE: This driver will attempt to use multiple page sized buffers to receive each jumbo packet. This should help to avoid buffer starvation issues when allocating receive packets.

NOTE: Packet loss may have a greater impact on throughput when you use jumbo frames. If you observe a drop in performance after enabling jumbo frames, enabling flow control may mitigate the issue.
See the section "Jumbo Frames" in the Readme.
.LP
.B EEE (Energy Efficient Ethernet)
.IP
.B Valid Range: 0-1
.IP
0 = Disables EEE
.IP
1 = Enables EEE
.IP

A link between two EEE-compliant devices will result in periodic bursts of data followed by periods where the link is in an idle state. This Low Power Idle (LPI) state is supported at 2.5 Gbps and 5 Gbps link speeds.

NOTES:
- EEE support requires auto-negotiation.
- Both link partners must support EEE.
- EEE is not supported on all Intel(R) Ethernet Network devices or at all link speeds.

Example:

# ethtool --show-eee <ethX>
# ethtool --set-eee <ethX> [eee on|off]
